v3.x - The Dice Roller & DM Tools

This major version introduced a complete dice rolling system, transforming ThorGridVTT into a more comprehensive VTT solution.

     v3.1.1 (Latest): Sound When Hitting Roll Button

        A short audible sound plays for rolling the dice, when you hit the button everyone with sound on will hear it as an audible marker as well as the visual log update.

    
    v3.1.0: DM Hidden Rolls

        The Game Master can now make "hidden" dice rolls. A toggle in the dice roller hides the results from players while keeping them visible to the DM, perfect for secret checks and suspense.

    v3.0.0: The Dice Roller Revolution

        Introduced a full-featured dice roller for the first time.

        Supports complex formulas like 2d20kh1 (advantage), 2d20kl1 (disadvantage), and modifiers like 5d8+5.

v2.x - Building the Modern VTT Experience

This series of releases laid the foundation for modern VTT functionality, focusing on immersion, game management, and quality-of-life improvements.

    v2.2.0 - Dynamic Vision & Walls

        A game-changing update that added Wall Collision. Tokens are now stopped by drawn walls, increasing immersion.

        The vision system was enhanced, allowing players to only see walls they are adjacent to, building upon the Fog of War system.

    v2.1.2 & v2.1.9 - Fog of War & Combat Stats

        The initial Fog of War system was implemented, obscuring the map from the players' view.

        Tokens were updated to display key Combat Stats like HP, making it easier for the GM and players to track combat status at a glance.

    Quality of Life & Platform Support (v2.1 - v2.2.8)

        Linux Support: Official .deb installers were introduced for Debian/Ubuntu based systems.

        UI/UX Toggles: Added toggle buttons to easily show/hide the entire map or the gridlines for all players.

        Compressed Game Saves: The export/import function was upgraded to handle large save states using .zip compression, preventing server disconnects.

        Custom Screen Size: Added the ability to define a custom screen size for your maps.

        Numerous bug fixes, including a critical fix to the token "Save" button for DMs (v2.1.7).

v1.x - The Foundation

The initial versions of ThorGridVTT established the essential "map and token" tools for basic gameplay.

    v1.0.4 - v1.0.6: Initial Release

        Established the core client/server architecture.

        Implemented distinct DM and Player roles.

        Allowed for uploading local images to use as tokens on a gridded map.

        Note: At this stage, the application did not include a dice roller or fog of war.
